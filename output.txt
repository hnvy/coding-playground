Hello, here we have a number in the string format (so, really, it's not a number): 73498
Woah, now we can use the placeholder print out an actual number: 847562
Let's experiment with some of these placeholders, shall we?
We can add many placeholders into one string, like so: (first number) 10 - (second number) 4 = (third number) 6
Interestingly, we can make C do the maths for us! Like so: 10 - 4 = 6
